## 3️⃣ System Architecture

### A. Presentation Layer (GUI Layer)
- Responsible for the graphical user interface (PyQt or Tkinter)  
- Does **not** contain business logic  
- Interacts only with the Business Layer

### B. Business Logic Layer (Service Layer)
- Contains all domain logic, calculations, and validations  
- Handles budget validation and transaction rules  
- Independent of UI and database

### C. Data Layer (Repository Layer)
- Responsible for data storage (SQLite, JSON, or API)  
- Contains Repositories and Interfaces  
- Allows changing the storage implementation without modifying the Business Layer

---

## 4️⃣ SOLID Principles
- **S (Single Responsibility):** Each class has one responsibility (e.g., `TransactionService`, `BudgetRepo`)  
- **O (Open/Closed):** Extend features without modifying existing classes  
- **L (Liskov Substitution):** Any repository can be replaced without breaking services  
- **I (Interface Segregation):** Small interfaces like `IBudgetRepo`, `ITransactionRepo`  
- **D (Dependency Inversion):** Upper layers depend on interfaces, not concrete classes

---

## 5️⃣ Features
- Expenses & Income Tracking  
- Budget Management  
- Notes & Goals system
